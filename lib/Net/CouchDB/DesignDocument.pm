=head1 NAME

Net::CouchDB::DesignDocument - a document containing views

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::CouchDB;
    # connect to the server and select a database
    my $design = $db->document('_design/example');
    print "Design uses the language " . $design->language . "\n";
    for my $view ( $design->views ) {
        print "A view named '" . $view->name . "'\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<Net::CouchDB::DesignDocument> object represents a single design document
within a CouchDB database.

=head1 METHODS

Remember that L<Net::CouchDB::DesignDocument> is a subclass of
L<Net::CouchDB::Document>, so any methods on that class are also relevant to
this class.

=head2 add_view($name, \%definition)

Adds a view named C<$name> to the design document where the hashref
C<$definition> provides the map and reduce components of the view.
If a view named C<$name> already exists, an exception is thrown.

Returns a L<Net::CouchDB::View> object.

=head2 language

Returns the name of the programming language in which the views of this design
document are implemented.

=head2 name

Returns the name of this design document.  This is the portion of the document
ID after "_design/".

=head2 view

Returns a single L<Net::CouchDB::View> object for the named view.  If no
such view exists, an exception is thrown.  To create a new view within
a design document, see L</add_view>.

=head2 views

Returns a list (or arrayref, depending on context) of L<Net::CouchDB::View>
objects representing all of the views defined within this design document.

=head2 uri

This is an internal function which returns the correct URI for this document
