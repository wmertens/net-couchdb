=head1 NAME

Net::CouchDB::ViewResultRow - a single result row from searching a view

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This method is intended for internal use.  To obtain a
L<Net::CouchDB::ViewResultRow> object, call methods such as
L<Net::CouchDB::ViewResult/first>.

=head2 document

Returns a L<Net::CouchDB::Document> object representing the document from
which this result row was derived.

If include_docs=>"true" is used as a search parameter, CouchDB will supply the
documents inline with the search results, resulting in less overall traffic.

=head2 id

Returns the DocID of the document that resulted in this row, which is the
unique identifier of that document in this database.

This is undefined for map+reduce queries.

=head2 key

Returns the key of this result row.  The key could be a single scalar value,
an arrayref or a hashref because CouchDB map functions can emit any
of those structures as a key.

=head2 result

Returns the L<Net::CouchDB::ViewResult> object of which this row is part.

=head2 value

Returns the value of this result row.  The value could be a single scalar
value, an arrayref or a hashref because CouchDB map functions can emit any of
those structures as values.

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

=head2 row

Returns a hashref indicating the raw row data returned from CouchDB.
